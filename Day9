### 📝 Practice (SQL Analytics)

```sql
-- Revenue with 7-day moving average
WITH daily AS (
  SELECT event_date, SUM(revenue) AS rev
  FROM gold.products
  GROUP BY event_date
)
SELECT
  event_date,
  rev,
  AVG(rev) OVER (
    ORDER BY event_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS ma7
FROM daily;

-- Conversion funnel
SELECT
  category_code,
  SUM(views) AS views,
  SUM(purchases) AS purchases,
  ROUND(SUM(purchases) * 100.0 / SUM(views), 2) AS conversion_rate
FROM gold.products
GROUP BY category_code;

-- Customer tiers
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN cnt >= 10 THEN 'VIP'
    WHEN cnt >= 5 THEN 'Loyal'
    ELSE 'Regular'
  END AS tier,
  COUNT(*) AS customers,
  AVG(total_spent) AS avg_ltv
FROM (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) AS cnt,
    SUM(price) AS total_spent
  FROM silver.events
  WHERE event_type = 'purchase'
  GROUP BY user_id
)
GROUP BY tier;
